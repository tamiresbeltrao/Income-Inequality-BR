# Income-Inequality-BR

## Description
The objective of this project was to evaluate important variables to explain Brazilian income inequality as measured by the 10/40 ratio (income of the 10% richest individuals divided by the income of the 40% poorest part of the population). Moreover, we performed the same analysis using a dummy variable created from the 10/40 ratio indicating whether the city is considered poor or rich.

## Data Source

## Methods

The following models were performed:
- Linear regression
